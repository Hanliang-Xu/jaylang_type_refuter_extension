	Abstract = {Extending a \emph{subtyping-constraint-based type inference}
                  framework with \emph{conditional constraints} and \emph{rows}
                  yields a powerful type inference engine. We illustrate this
                  claim by proposing solutions to three delicate type inference
                  problems: ``accurate'' pattern matchings, record concatenation,
                  and ``dynamic'' messages.  Until now, known solutions required
                  significantly different techniques; our theoretical contribution
                  is in using only a single (and simple) set of tools. On the
                  practical side, this allows all three problems to benefit from a
                  common set of constraint simplification techniques, leading to
                  efficient solutions.},

% Graphic lambda calculus
% Marius Buliga
% -- interesting mostly unrelated paper I bumped into, shows ties to knot theory and other fields of math.  This guy seems to have re-derived a lot of the optimal reduction graph stuff on his own.

% Wadsworth. Semantics and Pragmatics of the Lambda- Calculus - very early paper on graph-based reduction of lambda.

	abstract="After two decades of effort, type inference for dynamically typed languages scales to programs of a few tens of thousands of lines of code, but no further. For larger programs, this paper proposes using a kind of demand-driven analysis where the number of active goals is carefully restricted. To achieve this restriction, the algorithm occasionally prunes goals by giving them solutions that are trivially true and thus require no further subgoals to be solved; the previous subgoals of a newly pruned goal may often be discarded from consideration, reducing the total number of active goals. A specific algorithm DDP is described which uses this approach. An experiment on DDP shows that it infers precise types for roughly 30{\%} to 45{\%} of the variables in a program with hundreds of thousands of lines; the percentage varies with the choice of pruning threshold, a parameter of the algorithm. The time required varies from an average of one-tenth of one second per variable to an unknown maximum, again depending on the pruning threshold. These data suggest that 50 and 2000 are both good choices of pruning threshold, depending on whether speed or precision is more important.",

	pages="106--127",
	abstract="A singleton abstraction occurs in a program analysis when some results of the analysis are known to be exact: an abstract binding corresponds to a single concrete binding. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to constructing singleton abstractions via relative store fragments. Each store fragment is a locally exact store abstraction in that it contains only those abstract variable bindings necessary to address a particular question at a particular program point; it is relative to that program point and the point of view may be shifted. We show how an analysis incorporating relative store fragments achieves flow-, context-, path- and must-alias sensitivity, and can be used as a basis for environment analysis, without any machinery put in place for those specific aims. We build upon recent advances in demand-driven higher-order program analysis to achieve this construction as it is fundamentally tied to demand-driven lookup of variable values.",

abstract="We discuss how to perform symbolic execution of large programs in a manner that is both compositional (hence more scalable) and demand-driven. Compositional symbolic execution means finding feasible interprocedural program paths by composing symbolic executions of feasible intraprocedural paths. By demand-driven, we mean that as few intraprocedural paths as possible are symbolically executed in order to form an interprocedural path leading to a specific target branch or statement of interest (like an assertion). A key originality of this work is that our demand-driven compositional interprocedural symbolic execution is performed entirely using first-order logic formulas solved with an off-the-shelf SMT (Satisfiability-Modulo-Theories) solver -- no procedure in-lining or custom algorithm is required for the interprocedural part. This allows a uniform and elegant way of summarizing procedures at various levels of detail and of composing those using logic formulas.",

abstract = "Test case generation is among the most labour-intensive tasks in software testing. It also has a strong impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing. For these reasons, it has been one of the most active research topics in software testing for several decades, resulting in many different approaches and tools. This paper presents an orchestrated survey of the most prominent techniques for automatic generation of software test cases, reviewed in self-standing sections. The techniques presented include: (a) structural testing using symbolic execution, (b) model-based testing, (c) combinatorial testing, (d) random testing and its variant of adaptive random testing, and (e) search-based testing. Each section is contributed by world-renowned active researchers on the technique, and briefly covers the basic ideas underlying the method, the current state of the art, a discussion of the open research problems, and a perspective of the future development of the approach. As a whole, the paper aims at giving an introductory, up-to-date and (relatively) short overview of research in automatic test case generation, while ensuring a comprehensive and authoritative treatment."

abstract="Programmers often insert assertions in their code to be optionally checked at runtime, at least during the debugging phase. In the context of design by contracts, these assertions would better be given as a precondition of the method/procedure which can detect that a caller has violated the procedure's contract in a way which definitely leads to an assertion violation (e.g., for separate static analysis). We define precisely and formally the contract inference problem from intermittent assertions inserted in the code by the programmer. Our definition excludes no good run even when a non-deterministic choice (e.g., an interactive input) could lead to a bad one (so this is not the weakest precondition, nor its strengthening by abduction, since a terminating successful execution is not guaranteed). We then introduce new abstract interpretation-based methods to automatically infer both the static contract precondition of a method/procedure and the code to check it at runtime on scalar and collection variables.",

abstract="We describe a new approach to find models for a computational higher-order logic with datatypes. The goal is to find counter-examples for conjectures stated in proof assistants. The technique builds on narrowing¬†[14] but relies on a tight integration with a SAT solver to analyze conflicts precisely, eliminate sets of choices that lead to failures, and sometimes prove unsatisfiability. The architecture is reminiscent of that of an SMT solver. We present the rules of the calculus, an implementation, and some promising experimental results.",
