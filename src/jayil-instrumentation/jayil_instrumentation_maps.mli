(** Add an mapping from an odefa ident added during instrumentation to an
    odefa ident option, corresponding to some pre-instrumentation ident it
    aliases.  The value is None if there is not a corresponding aliased
    ident (e.g. vars added during match expr flattening). *)

(** Add a mapping from an odefa ident to the clause it identifies.  These ident
    to clause pairs must be added before instrumentation. *)

(** Returns whether the mapping was created during a translation of natodefa
    code or not. *)

(** Returns true if the ident was added during instrumentation, false
    otherwise. *)

(** Get an odefa clause that existed before the odefa program was
    instrumented.  If the odefa var was added during type instrumentation,
    it will return the clause representing the constrained operation.
    If the var was added before, it will return the clause it identified
    before instrumentation. *)
