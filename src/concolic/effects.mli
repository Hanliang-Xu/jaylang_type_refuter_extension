  Purpose: encapsulate concolic semantics into a monad

  Detailed description:
    The concolic semantics need state, error, environment, and logging.
    These are most efficiently composed into a CPS monad, as well.
    The benefit of the monad is that it contains all of the semantics
    specific to concolic evaluation.
    The downside is that performance is worse than using built-in effects
    and state from OCaml. The tradeoff for now is worth it: we have good
    separation of logic and follow the documented semantics closely.

    While it negatively affects inlining, we avoid passing around constants
    by initializing a functor with some constants. Behavior that is
    independent of these constants is extracted and statically intialized
    for better inlining.

    Currently, we use lists for logging. It is very likely to be more
    performant to include the logging in the state.
