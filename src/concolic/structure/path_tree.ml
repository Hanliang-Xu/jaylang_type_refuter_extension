(*
  Currently I have a type error here as I work this out.

  What I am doing is basically checking the whole tree each time
  if I could collapse. What I need to do is merge two nodes and
  get a message that says whether both were collapsed. If they were
  both collapsed, then we can collapse this.

  But really what we have is:
  * Merging statuses: if either has been collapsed, then we can forget about it and just collapse
      * This is because we only collapse if we know we have exhausted everything below. There is no point in keeping that unnecessary status if we have exhausted it before
  * Merging child: this is the same as merging a status because a child is a status with more info
  * Merging children: 
    * if one set of children have already been collapsed, then keep that
    * if one set is none, then keep the other
    * recursively call merge on the left and right of each.
      * if both end up as collapsed, then collapse. Otherwise, leave as is
  * Merging nodes:
    * recursively merge the children
    * if collapsed, then return that up (so that status can call collapse)

  What I should do is limit the merging to merge a tree with a single path. So I might need a
  single path type (which is really just a linked list) down the tree, and we merge trees with
  paths.

  Also I would want an update feature, where I can update a node at the end of the path. When I update,
  there is possibility of collapse.

  When I merge, I think I might still collapse in case that new hit node is a leaf in the tree, and
  that is what allows us to collapse.

  This motivates a change to merging:
    * I can only merge by giving a new path to add starting from another path. i.e. add a stem
    * So we take a tree, a path to where to attach the stem, and a stem

  So I think I should start with a new data structure, where it's easier to track what has been collapsed
  and easier to add stems
  * I want a node with formulas and children
  * The children should maybe have more status to them
    * We only ever have no children when interpretation finished, we hit a failed assume/assert, or the tree was pruned
    * So we can have children be "end of tree", "end of interpretation", "waiting to pass assume", or have the actual children
    * End of tree and end of interpretation are the exact same, I guess. They can be deleted
  * In place of unsolved, I'd like to have "active target"
  * The children really don't need to be identified with a key except just to be sure of correctness
    * Instead, it is equivalent to just have true/false sides
  * And I'd like to acquire the targets here. Just give a path of branches taken, and this returns the new targets.
    * Makes it much easier externally to track all this
  * Instead of building a node stack in the symbolic session, I'd prefer to keep a stack of formulas attained.
    * This is a list of formula sets and contains no constraints
    * The stack only begins after we've reached the depth of the target
    * Then just say to add this as a stem from the target, and tell the path tree whether it ended in failed assume or not
    * The path tree returns a new tree and the list of new targets
    * Note that the stack of formulas does need to have branches on it in order to add the contraints properly once handed over to the path tree
    * So the stack is (Branch.Runtime.t * Formula_set.t) list
      * Think about whether I really need it to be nonempty
        * I do because I need global formulas before first branch
*)

  MODULE SIGNATURES   
  -----------------

  We have lowercase type names for all types in recursive modules. We use destructive
  substitution to fill the types in when they're actually used as module signatures in the
  recursive modules.
