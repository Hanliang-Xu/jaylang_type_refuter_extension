(*
  SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE:
  * The concolic evaluator is currently built to only make each
    target once. Therefore, we can create a unique id upon target
    creation, and that is safe to use when comparing.
  * This will break if the concolic evaluator does not have this
    property, and it won't break loudly, so the developer must be
    very careful that this assumption continues to hold.
  * If only equality were needed, we would use `a == b`, as it
    does the same.
