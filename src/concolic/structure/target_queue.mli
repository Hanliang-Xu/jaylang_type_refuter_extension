  Purpose: store targets for easy popping

  Detailed description:
    Target queues are functional priorities queues that allow for
    quick retrieval of targets. They are mixed and matched by merging.

    This is just a trivial data structure holding targets.

  Dependencies:
    Options -- used to bound the queues
    Target -- is stored in the queues

module type S = sig
  type t
  val of_options : (unit, t) Options.Arrow.t
  val push_list : t -> Target.t list -> t
  val remove : t -> Target.t -> t
  val peek : t -> Target.t option
end

module DFS : S
(** [DFS] is bounded depth-first search. But actually we find it
    fruitful to do depth-first in increments, so it is sort of
    breadth-first in chunks, where chunks are explored depth-first. *)

module BFS : S
(** [BFS] is breadth-first search. *)

module Uniform : S
(** [Uniform] has random priority. *)

module Merge (_ : S) (_ : S) : S
(** [Merge (A) (B)] randomly pops like [A] and [B] with equal priority. *)

module All : S
(** [All] is [Merge (Merge (BFS) (DFS)) (Uniform)]. That is, DFS and BFS are
    chosen 1/4 of the time each, and Uniform is the other 1/2 of the time. *)
