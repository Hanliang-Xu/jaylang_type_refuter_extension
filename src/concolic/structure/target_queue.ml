  This implementation of BFS is somewhat dishonest. It is bread-first in that shallower targets
  are popped first, but the lexicographically smaller targets of the same depth are popped first, which is
  not typical. It is concise but not fully in depth-first spirit, so I leave it commented for now.

(*
  I want to have a heap that allows me to get the minimum-hit branch of those with targets.
  Then pop a target with that AST branch.
  I also need to remember how many times every branch has been hit so that it has the correct
  count when it is put in the heap.

  I think this warrants a refactor where I can create a target queue that has such a heuristic.
  I want to be able to use multiple heuristics, so I should join the target queues.
