(*
  This implementation of BFS is somewhat dishonest. It is breadth-first in that shallower targets
  are popped first, but the lexicographically smaller targets of the same depth are popped first, which is
  not typical. 

  Further, because many new targets get added at once from a single run that are not like the neighbors of a
  node in a typical tree search, no list-like queue can really ensure we visit the shallowest neighbors first.
  Thus, we use a priority search queue with the depth of the targets as the priority.

  To be sure that targets found first are dequeued first, we could use run number as the tie-breaker in priority.
