IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Progress: To guarantee that the translation process proceeds, the translation
  fragments must call the continuation translator on its results---whether it
  made progress or not.

- Correctness: To guarantee that the translation process fully executes, the
  translation fragments must only refer to other fragments are already
  defined---i.e., that come /before/ it.

- Completeness of mappings: To guarantee that the resugaring process will have
  all the information it needs, the following must hold:

  1. New `uid's must be generated for each AST node introduced during
  translation. (Old nodes being rearranged into new contexts don't need new
  `uid's.)

  2. `uid's must be used only once. (I.e., a subexpression can not be plugged
  into multiple holes in the resulting translation without refreshing---and
  mapping---`uid's.)

  3. Old nodes being destructed must be included in the mapping as auxiliary
  pointers---third position in the `log_entry' data type.

  4. All generated `uid's must be in the mapping. (I.e., every call to `next_uid
  ()' must have a corresponding `log_entry'.)

  5. All mappings from subordinate steps must be unioned. (I.e., every call to
  subordinate translators must have a corresponding `disjoint_union'.)

  6. Each /kind/ of mapping must have its own variant on the `log_entry' data
  type.

- Structure of mappings: A valid mapping is one in which the key is the `uid'
  for the newly generated piece of syntax, and the value is a pair---tagged with
  a `log_entry' variant---`(new_uid, original_uid)'.
