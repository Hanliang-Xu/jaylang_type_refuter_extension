(** Takes a step of demand-driven evaluation.  This routine returns any
    evaluation results it encounters in this step (as nondeterminism may lead to
    many) and an optional evaluation (if more evaluation may reveal more
    results).  As demand-driven evaluation is undecidable, there is no guarantee
    that a given evaluation will ever produce a result or terminate regardless
    of the number of evaluation steps taken. *)
