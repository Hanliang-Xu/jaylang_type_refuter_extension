(* forward
   we visit one nodes then its children
   when a node is visited, its parents may not be visited. we only know at least
   one of its parents are visited.

   What we need is a topological sorting.

   Before visiting a node (the node is candicate as a child of a visited node),
   we check if its parents are all visited.

   It will be similar to Clang::PostOrderCFGView.

   Forward & Backward? One-run & Multi-runs? Circles? Pre-order & Post-order?

   In `lookup`, it's an incremental processing to search children, therefore it's
   forward in the perspective of graph (through the lookup itself is a backward).

   A circle is not a problem in pre-order traversing since after a node is visited,
   it's still visited if coming back to itself again. We need a `visited` map to record it.

   `Lookup` is pre-order since we need to visit a node to create its children.
   **At present** generating constraints of a node has nothing to do with its children.
   (This can be optimized later to shrink many unnecessary infeasible cases)

   There is one use-case for post-order traversing `picked_from_root`:
      1) a node is picked from the solver result.
      2) and there is a path from this node to the root that all nodes are picked
   They are used together to exclude a node only picked by the SMT solver.

   A `visited` map is not suffient to implement a topological sorting on post-order visiting.

   Pre-order and post-order are more central to the traverse target.
   Forward and backward are of implementation. The choices on the same layer includes
   DFS, BFS, priority-queue. The main task is to reduce the complexity and prevent starvation.

(* for ddse,
   the node tree is a state it updates as the evaluating.
   it's also functional since in each non-deterministic run it updates differently.
   it needs to be compositional.

   phi_set is compositional with respect to non-determinism.
   It works because:
   1. non-determinism join on sets is straightforward.
   2. it composes bottom-up
