            the given [branch] that was just hit. If the other direction has already been hit, then nothing is
            updated. The [branch_key] is the variable in the clause for the [branch].

            TODO: consider just passing in the target that was just hit
            
            This way, when this is called during a concolic evaluation, the target branch after the call will
            be the deepest branch whose other side has been hit, and nothing under the other side is unhit.
            
            This ensures that when moving on from a branch, we've fully used all the information we can to hit
            everything in it. For sake of argument, suppose we target outermost branches first. Say the true side of the
            outer branch has a lot of internal branches, and we hit it first. The false side is then our target, and say it
            has no internal branches. The false side is hit easily, and then we must try to hit internal branches of
            the true side; we have no information to target these branches. For this reason, we target deeper
            branches first.
            
            outer_branch = outer_branch_condition ?
              (
                (* true side. Say it is hit first *)
                (* lots of internal branches *)
              ) :
              (
                (* false side. It is the target of the next run after hitting the first *)
                (* no internal branches *)
              )
            
            So in this program, we hit the true side, and then the false side, and then need to dive back into the
            true side but have no information to help us do so because we have only kept information from the false
            side.
