(** [add_alias t k k'] adds the formula that [k] and [k'] hold the same value in [t]. *)

val add_binop : t -> Lookup_key.t -> Jayil.Ast.binary_operator -> Lookup_key.t -> Lookup_key.t -> t
(** [add_binop t x op left right] adds the formula that [x = left op right] in [t]. *)

val add_input : t -> Lookup_key.t -> Dvalue.t -> t
(** [add_input t x v] is [t] that knows input [x = v] was given. *)

(** [hit_branch t branch] is [t] that knows [branch] has been hit during interpretation. *)

val fail_assume : t -> Lookup_key.t -> t
(** [fail_assume t key] tells [t] that the variable in [key] was false when it was assumed to be true. *)

(** [found_abort t] tells [t] that an abort was found in interpretation. *)

val reach_max_step : t -> t
(** [reach_max_step t] tells [t] that the max interpretation step was hit, and interpretation stopped. *)

val finish : t -> Root.t -> t
(** [finish t root] creates a finished session from [t] that merges info with the given [root].
    The merged result can be gotten with [root_exn @@ finish t root]. *)

val branch_info : t -> Branch_info.t
(** [branch_info t] is current branch info from [t]. *)

val hit_max_depth : t -> bool
(** [hit_max_depth t] is true iff [t] reached the max allowed tree depth. *)
