TODO:
* Try to resolve all of the todos I have left in the code. There are LOTS of them.
  * The following bullet points, though, try to summarize some of them.
* Continue with misses until steady state
* Handle max step
* Track inputs and solvers that lead to hits/misses -- i.e. payloads on branch statuses
* Port over logging (and figure out logging in general)
* Use input AST branches to customize output -- this is for use in the type checker
* Use variants instead of exceptions to make tracking easier
* Confirm that we only want int input
