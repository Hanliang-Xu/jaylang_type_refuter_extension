  Purpose: help store information about runtime variables and solve to hit branches.

  Detailed description:
    This module defines representations of runtime data to solve to hit branches
    in an AST. Values of runtime variables can be added to the solver underneath
    the parent branch as found during the interpretation of the program. Then a
    branch can be picked and solved for, and an input feeder is returned to attempt
    to hit that branch. It's not guaranteed that the inputs will allow the interpretation
    to hit the target branch.

  Logic description:
    The solver has a functional state that is the current parent branch: it is the
    global "branch" ie environment, or it is some local branch under a condition
    clause.

    Formulas are added underneath this parent, and when exiting the parent, they are
    accumulated and implied by the exited parent and put underneath the new parent.

    When solving, all formulas from the global scope are added to a Z3 solver and
    used to make an input feeder. The Z3 solver is mutable, but the scope of the solver
    is only inside the `get_feeder` function, so to the user, this module is entirely
    functional.

exception NoParentException
(** Used to convey that the user of the solver is trying to add a formula or back up to
    a previous parent when there is no such parent. If the solver is used properly on a
    valid Jayil program, this should be logically impossible. *)

(** [t] is a solver that tracks expressions during evaluation of Jayil program. It has a

val merge : t -> t -> t
(** [merge a b] adds all formulas in [b] to [a]. Both [a] and [b] must be "in" the global environment. *)
