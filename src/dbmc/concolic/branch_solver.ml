  TODO:
    Really, I should completely revamp this. I just need to have a stack of current parent and formula list.
    That is sufficient because we're under one parent at a time. And we can recurse up the parents to make
    a pick formula.
    And we leave a parent into the next one by creating the implies with the "and" of all formulas we're leaving.
    We need to track formulas along with the parent stack because we may enter and leave a parent as we hit
    branches in the clause list, and we ought to keep the formulas we've already seen.

    We can either have a global store separately (I think this is a good idea) or have the global be the last
    on the stack.
    The reason to keep it separate is to more easily merge solvers and to add the persistent formulas.
    The reason to keep it not separate is to make sure that we've properly collected the entire stack into the
    final global formulas before merging or solving, but this is a runtime assertion, so it's not necessarily
    safer programming.

    I'm not sure yet if the formula stacks should be in parallel (each their separate stack) or coupled (as a stack
    of tuples or records). To ensure safer programming and to let type-checking catch my coding mistakes, it's
    probably best to keep them coupled even if that is slightly clunky.

    Do separately keep the top value of the stack or always peek at the top value of the stack?
    If we store separately, it's still a bunch of copying pointers because all the record values need to be copied.
    If peeking the stack, we are constantly making a new stack and copying the back.
    So for efficiency, it doesn't matter. It only matters how I care to do the pattern matching: on a variant that
    helps track state, or just let the stack convey the state. This is to be decided after just a little bit of
    coding and designing.

    Then can wrap up the branch solver into a formula set when done, which makes for much easier and logically sound/safe
    merging of solvers. And we can delegate any persistent formula logic (ie anything that interacts with a Z3 expr) to
    the solver (which we can force to only happen when in global scope, or just let it happen any time by keeping global
    scope separate). So the difference between the branch solver and the concolic session is that the branch solver
    actually interacts directly with Z3 exprs (so should make `add_alias` and not let formulas get passed directly).

    The concolic session still tracks extra stuff like hit targets, abort information, target, etc, but the solver
    tracks current parent and actual expression.

  TODO:
    We'd like to satisfy as many of the pick formulas as possible while still keeping the target satisfiable. This is probably
    NP hard because we would try the powerset of the pick formulas, but we seem to miss the target when we give an input that
    is not very precise and we hit an unexpected branch that we don't have any info about, so it throws stuff off.
