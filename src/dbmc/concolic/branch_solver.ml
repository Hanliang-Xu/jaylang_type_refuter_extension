(*
  The parent is some condition key and the direction that it
  evaluates.

  The name of the condition variable and the call stack uniquely
  make a lookup key that identifies the parent.

  Usage:
    Every variable in the program that is not in the global scope or
    a function environment has a parent branch. The direction the parent
    evaluates to determines if the variable is reachable or not.

    e.g.
    c = true;
    x = c ? (
      y = 0
    ) : (
      z = 0
    )
    Here y has parent (c, true), and z has parent (c, false). z is only 0
    if c evaluates to false.

    | Global -> failwith "global runtime branch undefined"
      
  end

(*
  The parent store tracks all the parent conditions that a variable depends on, but
  none greater than its immediate parent.

  e.g.
    cond = true;
    x = cond ? (
      inner_condition = false;
      inner_result = inner_condition ? (
        not_reached = 0;
      ) : (
        reached = 1;
      )
      w = 1;
      z = inner_result + w;
    )
    Then `reached` depends on `inner_condition` == false, and
    `z` depends on `inner_result`, which is an alias for `reached`.
    So `z` gains `inner_condition` == false as a parent because it
    depends on `inner_condition`, but it won't gain any parents that are
    parents on `cond`.

  Generate the parent dependencies of all the children in the list, and return an
  expression list for the parents, and a list of the parents as keys.

  The returned lists are well-described by an example.
    Say a child key depends on two parents (P1, true), (P2, false), i.e.
    the parent key P1 must be true to reach the child key, and P2 must be false.
    So the expression list is
      [ (P1 == true) ; (P2 == false) ]
    and the parent key list is
      [ P1 ; P2 ]
    If multiple children are passed in, then the returned lists are the concatenation
    of all the lists for each child.

  A node might have multiple "parents" if it depends on some variable with a
  different parent. Then we just claim that node has as parents both its "real"
  parent and the parent(s) of the node it depends on. See the comment above `parent_store`
  above.

  Given some children nodes, get a formula that says the parents

  So if children have some list of expressions implied by their parents, then
  then that list is some formula, say f0. What this returns is f0 => formula,
  where formula is given.

  We'll get this

  that is tracked. It will rarely be the real root.

  when the parent of the current branch is reached.)
