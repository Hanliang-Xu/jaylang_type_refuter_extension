Corpse Reviver: Sound and Efficient Gradual Typing via Contract Verification
https://github.com/camoy/corpse-reviver
We use the benchmark suite first developed by Takikawa et al. [2016] (Is Sound Gradual
Typing Dead?) and expanded by Greenman et al. [2019].6 Our evaluation pits SCV-CR against Typed Racket on 12 of the 20 programs in the
benchmark suite.

Q: What is the difference between `lia` and `dorder_lia`
A: No answer yet.
Searching `dorder` in `hopv` suggests an APLOS'17 paper, but no one matches after checking.
I asked on it on GitHub.

The `vender/hopv/diff_lia_dorder_lia.diff` shows the `dorder` versions

1. The majority is the same.
2. `dorder` annotates a few more types.
3. `if` clause and `assert` clause always comes with a `else ()`.
