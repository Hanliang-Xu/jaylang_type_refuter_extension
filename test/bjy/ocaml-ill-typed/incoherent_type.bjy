  This test is taken from OCaml:
    testsuite/tests/typing-modules/functors.ml
*)

let F (dependent A : sig val t : type --> type end)
  (B : sig
    val t : type --> type
    val f : (a : type) -> A.t a -> t a
  end) : sig end = struct end

(* The definition of `F` and its application belows disagree on
    the arity of `t`, we should not equate the two types *)

(*
  This is especially obvious in Bluejay, where higher arity types are
  just functions. But I leave the comments from the OCaml tests because
  they're fun :)

let _ = F
  (struct
    let t = unit    (* this is bogus! *)
  end)
  (struct
    let t = unit    (* this was originally missing, but I've put it in to isolate the error *)
    let f _ x = x   (* this is bogus! *)
