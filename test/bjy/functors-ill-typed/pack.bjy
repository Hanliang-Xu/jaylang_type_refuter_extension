  We don't have destructive substitution like we might write in OCaml:
    ... -> S with type 'a x := 'a X.t
  so I just leave it unconstrained. We do have singlet, but it doesn't work
  with higher kinded types like `X.t`.

      ERROR: didn't apply int here, or bool in the second case.
      This is more like "separate" than "pack", but it still doesn't make sense.

      A similar error is to accidentally use `singlet (X.t int)` (in both S and here),
      and leave `compare` unchanged. That would just be on the wrong level of types.
