  This shows that we easily get unbound variables, and we should
  vanish on them instead of break
*)

let g = 
  let x = 0 in
  fun i -> x

let f = 
  let y = 0 in
  fun i -> y (* this has the same callstack as in g above *)

let _ = f 0 (* so when looking up the env to use for f, we might use the one in g and get unbound var y. *)
