# This program has a condition inside of a recursive function that is hit only if
# the function hits some recursive depth. The input determines the depth.
# This used to pass, but idk what changed and now it seems to stall. Maybe it's that I'm not connected to power, 
# so it runs slower, and I'm not waiting long enough.
