**Pros:**
- Honest to goodness dependent types!
- No need to implement type aliasing as a special thing
- Much more expressive in general

**Cons:**
- Meta-correctness question: Is the type declaration really a type, or a non-type value? <- We can check for this though, and it shouldn't be terrible?
-
