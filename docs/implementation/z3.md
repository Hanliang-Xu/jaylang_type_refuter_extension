# Z3 in Jaylang

We only model integers and booleans in Z3. Every other runtime value in Bluejay is just a structure that, deep down, tends to hold an integer or boolean that actually does have a Z3 expression.

## Z3 semantics

Modulus, remainder, and division are unintuitive if you come from OCaml, C, or any typical programming language. Here are some examples.

```
 5 mod  3 => 2
-5 mod  3 => 1
 5 mod -3 => 2
-5 mod -3 => 1

 5 rem  3 =>  2
-5 rem  3 =>  1
 5 rem -3 => -2
-5 rem -3 => -1

 5 div  3 =>  1
-5 div  3 => -2   bleh!
 5 div -3 => -1
-5 div -3 =>  2   double bleh!
```

## OCaml semantics

```
 5 mod  3 =>  2
-5 mod  3 => -2
 5 mod -3 =>  2
-5 mod -3 => -2

 5 /  3 =>  1
-5 /  3 => -1
 5 / -3 => -1
-5 / -3 =>  1
```

Therefore in OCaml, `x mod y` is the same as `x - y * (x / y)`, so if we correctly model division, then we have modulus.

We notice that compared to Z3, when the dividend is negative (e.g. `-5` above), OCaml is one closer to 0, unless there is no remainder (e.g. `6 / 3`). Otherwise, the answer is the same.

We model division with the following function, where `|` is "divides". Then modulus is derived naturally.

```
let (/) x y =
  if y | x or 0 <= x
  then div x y (* standard z3-style division *)
  else
    if 0 <= y
    then div x y + 1
    else div x y - 1
```
